# Matilde Wittrup tutorial site
This code is going to be used for a tutorial site I'm publishing online. At the moment this project only have the frontend code done.

## Frontend
The frontend consist of the following tech-stack:
* ReactJS
* React-redux, Redux, Redux thunk.
* React-router
* **Axios** to communicate with backend later on (Ruby-on-Rails)
* **PropTypes**
* Custom made CSS framework

Text marked as **bold** is because it isn't used yet in the project but are going to be used later in development.
