# Matilde Wittrup - Tutorial site
This code is going to be used for a tutorial site I'm publishing online. At the moment this project only have the frontend code done.

## Technical specifications
The frontend consist of the following tech-stack:
* ReactJS
* React-redux, Redux, Redux thunk.
* React-router
* **Axios** to communicate with backend later on (Ruby-on-Rails)
* **PropTypes**
* Custom made CSS framework

Text marked as **bold** is because it isn't used yet in the project but are going to be used later in development.

## Commands
When you've downloaded the repo run `yarn install` to install all modules.

Run application by using `yarn start` which will open the site on port 3000 as default.

Build application by running `yarn build`.

## Configuration
All configurations will be put inside `.env.development` and `.env.production`.
